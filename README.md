>*"There is magic in graphs. The profile of a curve reveals in a flash a whole situation â€” the life history of an epidemic, a panic, or an era of prosperity. The curve informs the mind, awakens the imagination, convinces"*. Henry D. Hubbard

I am a person who loves data visualisation so this will be a main focus of this project so I will continue to add visualisations to this project over the coming days & weeks...


Over time, this notebook will cover also data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, mapping, feature importance, correlations, machine learning, model selection and evaluation of the model.
